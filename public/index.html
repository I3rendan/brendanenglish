    Hey there, curious person!

    This is my portfolio site (obviously). I've been at this design and development thing since the late 90's and this site is meant to be a tribute to the glory days and also to showcase how I got to where I am today.

    I built this in React and am using a few interesting components to bring a bit of delight to the experience. "Why would this guy use React to create a simple site?" you may be asking yourself... well, I didn't HAVE to but I thought it would be nice to showcase that I can actually use the things I say I know how to use.

    I'm always looking for a fun project so please let me know if you have anything you need help with or have any neat employment opportunities (brendan@brendanenglish.com). Thanks for reading!
